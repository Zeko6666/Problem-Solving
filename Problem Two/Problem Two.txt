	Problem : 
		You are given list of numbers,obtained by rotating a sorted list 
		an unknown number of times.Write a function to determine the mininmum 
		number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given
		list.Your function should have the worst-case complexity of (log N) ,
		where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers
		in the list are unique.

		 Example : the list [5,6,9,0,2,3,4] was obtained by rotating the sorted    
		  list [0,2,3,4,5,6,9] 3 times 
		
		we define "rotating a list" as removing the last element of the list and
		adding it before the first element. ex rotating the list [3,2,4,1] 
		produces [1,3,2,4]

		"Sorted list" refers to list where the elements are arranged in 
		the increasing order ex. [1,3,5,7]
